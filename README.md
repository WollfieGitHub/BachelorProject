## Naming Conventions
Because I'm new to this world I may not have adopted the usual naming conventions about robotic
arms right away so here is how I named the different parts of the robot :



## Building Prerequisites

### Electronics


### Mechanical Pieces

#### Screws
- [x16] : M4*12mm > Nema 17 Stepper Upper connection
- [x12] : M3*20mm > Nema 17 to Gearbox Adapter Connection
  - You might not need these
- 

### Raw Material

## Assembly Instructions
Some holes (I'm thinking about the motors' upper connection but there might be more) need
to be enlarged so the needed screw can fit


## Control Software
